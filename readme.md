This is a framework for data collection from Reddit. 

I developed this framework during my PhD to make the data collection easier. 

Reddit is a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website. There are many many subreddits with different topics that carry a huge amount of text/link information which can be useful for research. One can filter the posts in Reddit by keywords and save the posts in a database.

I hope it would be useful for everyone.

Do not hesitate to contact me for any question.
